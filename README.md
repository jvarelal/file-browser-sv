# Svelte-browser

Basic web based file browser with nodeJS and giving a try on Svelte. 

## Get started

To give a first try, locate on path:

```bash
npm run tryon
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

A little messy, but it will install all front/back dependencies, generate front build and start server.

Navigate to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). You should see the app running. 

## New execution

After first execution and with no new changes, only running follow command will work:

```bash
npm start
```

## Single-page app mode

By default, sirv will only respond to requests that match files in `public`. This is to maximise compatibility with static fileservers, allowing you to deploy your app anywhere.

If you're building a single-page app (SPA) with multiple routes, sirv needs to be able to respond to requests for *any* path. You can make it so by editing the `"start"` command in package.json:

```js
"start": "sirv public --single"
```

## Using TypeScript

This template comes with a script to set up a TypeScript development environment, you can run it immediately after cloning the template with:

```bash
node scripts/setupTypeScript.js
```

Or remove the script via:

```bash
rm scripts/setupTypeScript.js
```

If you want to use `baseUrl` or `path` aliases within your `tsconfig`, you need to set up `@rollup/plugin-alias` to tell Rollup to resolve the aliases. For more info, see [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63427935/setup-tsconfig-path-in-svelte).

## Deploying to the web

### With [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

Install `vercel` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```

### With [surge](https://surge.sh/)
